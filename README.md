# ASLproject
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm to get a computer to distinguish between ASL images.
I am using an ASL alphabet database from kaggle which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

Here is the complete project outline: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ZJ-UoV0qIZ496GJwkGhrHfTzv3HM8L-J2h8ImQB33k/edit?ts=5d13959e#heading=h.plufjnofdjik
